# Javascript
- default behaviour is synchronous and single threaded

## execution context
- one line of ocode at a time
- each operations waits for previous to complete before execution

## blocking code
- block the flow of program
- eg: wait until i bring water,dont do anything untilll i come

## non-blocking code
- did not block execution
